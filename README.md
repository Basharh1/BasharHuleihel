# Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a technique to compute upper and lower bounds on the capacity of unifilar finite-state channels (FSCs) with feedback. The theoretical details of the technique are presented in the following paper:

[Graph-Based Encoders and their Performance for Finite-State Channels with Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08063), introduced by Oron sabag, Bashar Huleihel, Haim Permuter.
